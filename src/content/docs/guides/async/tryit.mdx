## Basic usage

Error-first callbacks were cool. Using mutable variables to hoist state when doing try/catch was not cool.

The `tryit` function let's you wrap a function to convert it to an error-first function. **Works for both async and sync functions.**

```ts
import { tryit } from 'radash'

const [err, user] = await tryit(api.users.find)(userId)
```

### Currying

You can curry `tryit` if you like.

```ts
import { tryit } from 'radash'

const findUser = tryit(api.users.find)

const [err, user] = await findUser(userId)
```
