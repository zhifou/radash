description: Split an array into two arrays by a condition
---

## Basic usage

Given an array of items and a condition, returns two arrays where the first contains all items that passed the condition and the second contains all items that failed the condition.

```ts
import { fork } from 'radash'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    power: 100
  },
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 98
  },
  {
    name: 'Loki',
    power: 72
  },
  {
    name: 'Vishnu',
    power: 100
  }
]

const [finalGods, lesserGods] = fork(gods, f => f.power > 90) // [[ra, vishnu, zues], [loki]]
```
