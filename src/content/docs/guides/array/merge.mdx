description: Combine two lists overriding items in the first
---

## Basic usage

Given two arrays of items and an identity function, returns the first
list with all items from the second list where there was a match.

```ts
import { merge } from 'radash'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 92
  },
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    power: 97
  }
]

const newGods = [
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 100
  }
]

merge(gods, newGods, f => f.name) // => [{name: "Zeus" power: 100}, {name: "Ra", power: 97}]
```
