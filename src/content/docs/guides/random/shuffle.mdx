## Basic usage

Given an array of items, return a new array with the items in a random order.

```ts
import { shuffle } from 'radash'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean'
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river'
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river'
  }
]

shuffle(fish)
```

Note, this is not a cutting edge performance optimized function. This function is optimized for simplicity and best used as a utility. If performance is a priority for you, use a randomness and/or shuffle library.
