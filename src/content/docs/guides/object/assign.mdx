## Basic usage

Merges two objects together recursively into a new object applying values from right to left. Recursion only applies to child object properties.

```ts
import { assign } from 'radash'

const ra = {
  name: 'Ra',
  power: 100
}

assign(ra, { name: 'Loki' })
// => { name: Loki, power: 100 }
```
